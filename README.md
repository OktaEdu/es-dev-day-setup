# Developer Day 2021 Lab: Deploy a custom SPA app with Terraform
In this lab, you will leverage 3 Terraform configurations to deploy a Single Page App (SPA).
## Overview
Create and deploy your custom app in less time with fewer errors using sample code and Terraform automation provided by Okta. In 90 minutes or less, youâ€™ll learn how to do user mappings and assignments, and deploy your app into production. Easily tweak what you learn for your other apps. Developers, DevOps, and DevSecOps will benefit from this lab that showcases a typical CIAM use case.
